# Deviation from neutral species abundance distributions unveils biogeography of diatom communities

In the last years, advances in metagenomics have allowed for a unique picture of plankton communities and their large-scale global distribution. Although these results have shed a light on the behavior of the oceanic protist ensemble, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between species abundance distributions and marine environmental conditions for diatoms, primary player in the global carbon cycle. Our work investigates if diatoms display everywhere a similar structure, being part of a unique metacommu- nity. We use Tara Oceans dataset and employ a downscaling framework to predict the structure of the local diatom community at a specific location from the properties of a reference sampling station. Although the average diversity can be well inferred from the reference meta-community, we find that the hypothesis of a single, ocean-wide global diatom community is not supported by the data. We show instead a significant correlation between deviations in observed and predicted biodiversity versus environmental variables such as temperature.
